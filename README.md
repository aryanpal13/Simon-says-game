# Simon Game

A web-based *Simon Says memory game* inspired by the classic 1978 electronic game. 
This project was built using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript* and challenges the player's ability to remember sequences of lights and sounds that get longer with each level.

## Game Description

*Simon Says* is a pattern memory game. 
The system randomly lights up buttons in a certain sequence, and the user must reproduce that exact sequence by clicking the same buttons in the correct order.

Each successful round adds a new button to the sequence, increasing the difficulty as the game progresses. 
If the user clicks the wrong button, the game ends and resets.
